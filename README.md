# FastBitMasteringMCU1

This is a repository with the exercise files from the course **Mastering microcontroller with embedded development** from [Fastbit](http://fastbitlab.com) that is avaiable on udemy on link: https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-microcontroller-with-peripheral-driver-development

To do the Target exercises I've used the [Nucleo-F446RE](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f446re.html) Board from ST.  The exercise files were adapted to work with this board. 

To compile the source files I used **STM32CubeIDE 1.1.0**
